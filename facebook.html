      Facebook is an American online social media and social networking service
      owned by Meta Platforms. Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow
      Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum,
      Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book
      directories often given to American university students. Membership was
      initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North
      American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of
      2020, Facebook claimed 2.8 billion monthly active users,[2] and ranked
      seventh in global internet usage.[7] It was the most downloaded mobile app
      of the 2010s.[8]
