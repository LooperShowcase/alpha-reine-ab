          We want Instagram to be a place where people can be inspired every
          day. We foster a safe and inclusive community where people can express
          themselves, feel closer to anyone they care about and turn a passion
          into a living.

      Instagram[a] is an American photo and video sharing social networking
      service founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. In April 2012, Facebook
      Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and
      stock. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with
      filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be
      shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other
      users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can
      like photos and follow other users to add their content to a personal
      feed.[10] Instagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content
      to be framed in a square (1:1) aspect ratio with 640 pixels to match the
      display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, these restrictions were
      eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added messaging
      features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single
      post, and a 'stories' feature—similar to its main opposition
      Snapchat—which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential
      feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January
      2019, the Stories feature is used by 500 million users daily.[10]
